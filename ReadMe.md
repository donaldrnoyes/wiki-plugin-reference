# Federated Wiki (experimental) - Reference Plugin

*This federated wiki plugin is part of an experimental code refactoring, which is very much a work in progress. See [WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki) (ruby), or [WardCunningham/wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/wiki) (node), for the current stable versions.*

References are paragraphs that are used as bibliographic references to pages elsewhere in the federation. References can bypass the usual link resolution process to go straight to a remote site.
